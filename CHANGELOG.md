## 5.16.1 - 2024.10.05
### Added
 - `.meta` files that are auto generated by Unity
### Removed
 - Tests and Examples are removed due to incompatibility with Unity

## _**Fork**_ - Stateless for Unity

## 5.16.0 - 2024.05.24
### Changed
 - Permit state reentry from dynamic transitions [#565]
   - This is a change in behavior from v5.15.0 (see [#544]); this version restores the previous behavior for `PermitDynamic` that allows reentry;
     if reentry is not the desired behavior, consider using a guard condition with `PermitDynamicIf`.
 - Remove getDestination, and use Destination property instead (internal refactor) [#575]
### Added
 - Add overloads to `FireAsync` to support parameterized trigger arguments [#570]
 - Add overloads to `CanFire` to support parameterized trigger arguments [#574]
### Fixed
 - Prevent `NullReferenceException` in the `InvocationInfo` class [#566]

## 5.15.0 - 2023.12.29
### Changed
 - Updated net6.0 build target to net8.0 [#551]
 - New abstract method, `GetInitialTransition`, added to `GraphStyleBase` to remove DOT graph implementation from `StateGraph` [#557]
   - Classes that are derived from `GraphStyleBase` and are being migrated from an earlier release of Stateless will need to implement this method.
### Added
 - Added license information and README file to NuGet package [#539], [#553]

## 5.14.0 - 2023.11.14
### Added
 - Enable Source Link & Deterministic Builds [#501]

 - Update example apps to `net6.0` [#520]
 - Bump solution Visual Studio version to 2022 [#526]
 - Remove obsolete TargetFrameworks [#524]
 - Added `FireAsync(TriggerWithParameters, params object[])` overload [#536]
### Fixed
 - `StateMachineInfo.InitialState.Transitions` throws if `AddRelationships` not called [#514]
 - Trigger information is missing for `OnEntryFromAsync` [#511]
 - Fixed typos & redundant parentheses [#512], [#521], [#522]
 - Change mechanism for losing the synchronization context [#528]
 - `InvalidOperationException` thrown from call to `FireAsync` [#532]
 - Added missing guard function parameter support from `InternalTransitionAsyncIf` [#530]
 - Using `PermitIf` on a state with substates leads to reentry [#544]

### Added
 - Added CanFire overload to return unmet guard descriptions [#443]
### Fixed
 - Inconsistency in sync/async statemachine execution [#444]
 - Added support for spaces in state/trigger names in Graphviz node graphs by wrapping them in escaped quotes [#447]

## 5.10.1
Re-releasing 5.2.0 as v5.10.1.
The version number was accidentally set to 5.10 when creating the 5.2 release.
Version 5.10.0 is now listed as the newest, since it has the highest version number.
5.2.0 and 5.10.0 are identical.

## 5.2.0
### Added
 - Added support for net50
### Changed
 - Only run tests under net50
 - Non-code change: Switch to using Github Actions

### Fixed
- Fixed bug "When adding .PermitDynamicIf, call .PermitTriggers throw NullReferenceException" [#416]

## 5.1.7 - 2021.01.10
### Fixed
 - Fixed nullReferenceException when getting permitted triggers on a dynamic transition. [#413]

## 5.1.7 - 2021.01.10
### Fixed

## 5.1.6 - 2020.11.21
### Fixed
 - Added support for new OnTransitionCompletedEvent, which is run after all OnExit / OnEntry methods have run [#394]

### Fixed
 - Fixed ambiguos guard function call when trigger is a state [#380]
 
## 5.1.2 - 2020.04.27

## [5.1.1] - 2020.04.03
### Changed
- Inverted if (_firingMode.Equals(FiringMode.Immediate) into if (FiringMode.Immediate.Equals(_firingMode) to avoid VerificationException  when including assembly AllowPartiallyTrustedCallers [#365].

## [5.1.0] - 2020.03.24
### Added
- Added missing possible destination states to all PermitDynamic and PermitDynamicIf, see issue [#305].

### Fixed

## [5.0.0] - 2020.02.28
